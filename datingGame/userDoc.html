	- You are the matcher (say M) and your goal is to find an ideal date for a person P.
	- There are fixed 10 attributes and person P's criteria for liking a date or not depend on the weights given to various attributes.
	- You as a Matcher do not know the weights of those attributes.
	- The weights are be positive or negative ranging from -1 to 1 and up to two decimal values.
	- Now, the game generates 20 random candidates (one of them is Ideal i.e. Score*=1)
	- Each of these candidates has a liking or disliking for each attribute (displayed as 1 or 0).
	- *Score of a candidate C is the dot product of 'P's weights for each attribute' and 'C's value for each attribute'
	
	- Now you choose a candidate and based on the score you try to understand P's requirements.
	- Learning from candidates and their scores, your goal is to find the ideal candidate in least number of guesses!!
