		<span>Some of the stuff am fanatic about is as:
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5>Maths</h5>
		<p>
			I love mathematics, although I know very little of it. I enjoy thinking of practical problems with a mathematical cap and I usually find, almost everything can be capped. 
			I enjoy thinking of formal proofs of obvious problems which many a times don't end up being obvious. I am an ardent thinker, and I randomly think of random problems trying to find a pattern in chaos. 
			<br>One of the reasons for this interest could be - this is the only subject I have consistently been able to score in :)
			(trust me - in my struggling school life, I have stumbled in many)
		</p>
	    <br>
		
		<h5>Social entrepreneurship</h5>
		<p>
			I strongly believe that every you and me has atleast a small bit of social responsibilty which he/ she should seriously keep as a primay todo item in his laundry list.
			Just a small bit from every one of us can create a lot of change and make things much better. Our contribution in any form might turn in betterment of many. </p>
		<p>	
			I adore many people and appreciate the kind of work and effort they are putting in. I ardently read about initiaves taken up by people, ruminate their ideas and try and contribute in ways possible.
			I have volunteered at, Multi-sectoral approaches for the Child Labor Eradication Project in CIDev, an NGO June â€“ July, 2008, the Liberty Science Centre and the Youth For Seva initiave.
			As a co-founder of <a href="http://www.sparshnitk.org">Sparsh Scholarship Foundation</a> (a registered NGO initiative), we try to head into other possible challenging areas and touch the lives of as many deserving needy children..
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>Travel and adventure </h5>
		<p>
			Travelling new places is always an excitement. I have had chance to explore almost whole of my native country, India - with diversity noticed at almost every end.
			Being from a religious family, I have been to many many sacred shrines at altitudes of Himalayas [all by walk :)].<br>
			Mountains, rivers, beaches, tea gardens, falls, tracking, para sailing, water biking are some of the explored areas.
			
			Am now all set to explore infinitely many unxplored horizons - bungy jumping seems to be the next. 
                                                                                                           
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>Puzzles </h5>
		<p>
			I enjoy solving puzzles. This is something where my random web crawling usually ends at. After solving many or after knowing the answers of many,
			I actually think of how did people manage to create or come out with such a problem/ solution. Bow to the geniuses!
			<br>
			Having had chance of winning an <i>Online Puzzle Solving</i> competition at IITM, I like to baost of having thougt of few solutions in my dreams. LoL <br>
			All apart, I also believe, attimes am slow at solving them :|
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h5>Badminton </h5>
		<p>
			Playing any sport is fun. For me, Badminton surely has a special space.
			Am lucky to find and continue my sports regime at <a href="http://www.gonyuathletics.com/sports/2008/8/19/coles.aspx"> The Coles Sports Center</a>, NYU. 
			Am able to hit here almost twice a week (althogh the schedule makes it all real difficult).
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>Stocks </h5>
		<p>
			I enjoy these everchanging numbers. Everything is so wyswyg!! 
			I have tried trading many stocks and ipo's (BSE) in my past - both randomly and by some calculations. Made some bucks too :) <br>
			My current schedule is so damn challening to find time for everything. I still own some of the stocks - have no clue of how those stock are doing.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>Others </h5>
		<p>
			startups, tech, quotes, psychology, poems, art, health..
		</p>
